# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered during the Expo CLI build process. The error is characterized by vague error messages that do not clearly point to the root cause.  The issue is typically related to dependency version conflicts or misconfigurations in the project's `package.json` or `app.json` files. 

## Problem
The `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android` command fails with an unclear error message, making it difficult to identify and resolve the underlying issue.  This often involves unexpected native module conflicts or incompatibilities between Expo SDK versions and project dependencies.

## Solution
This repository provides a sample project that reproduces the error and demonstrates the steps taken to resolve it. The solution often involves careful review of `package.json` dependencies and their versions, potentially using `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze the dependency tree.  Also, examining `app.json` configurations, such as those related to native modules and their versions is crucial.  In some cases, updating Expo CLI itself or related plugins might be necessary.
