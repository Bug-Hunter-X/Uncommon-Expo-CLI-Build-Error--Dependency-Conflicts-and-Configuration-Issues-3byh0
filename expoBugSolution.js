The solution involves systematically investigating the project's dependencies and configuration. 

1. **Check `package.json`:** Carefully examine the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file. Look for conflicting versions or dependencies that may be incompatible with your Expo SDK version. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate the dependency tree and identify potential conflicts.
2. **Check `app.json`:** Review your `app.json` file for any configurations related to native modules or plugins. Ensure that the configurations are correct and compatible with your dependencies and Expo SDK version.
3. **Update Dependencies:**  Update your project's dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.  Consider updating Expo CLI itself.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clean your project's build cache (often by deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling your dependencies) and rebuild the project. 
5. **Examine Log Files:** Carefully examine the error logs generated during the build process. Look for detailed error messages or warnings that might provide more clues.
6. **Isolate the Problem:**  If possible, create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problematic dependency or configuration.
7. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online forums, GitHub issues, and Stack Overflow for similar problems.  Providing the relevant error messages in your search query will increase the likelihood of finding a solution.
