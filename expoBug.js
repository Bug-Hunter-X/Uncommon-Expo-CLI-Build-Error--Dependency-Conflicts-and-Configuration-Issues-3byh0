This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has certain dependencies or configurations. The root cause is often related to mismatched versions of dependencies, incorrect configurations in `package.json` or `app.json`, or conflicts with native modules.  A common manifestation is a cryptic error message during the build process, such as "Error: Command failed: ..." or similar, without clear indication of the problem's origin. The error logs may be insufficient to pinpoint the cause.
